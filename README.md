# Welcome to my personal skin pack, you can download and customize this skin pack for personal use or publish your own version.

## How to use in game:

### Android:

* Download the zip file.
* Open your file manager.
* Extract the zip file you have previously downloaded into the folder "Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/skin_packs/ (if your file manager cannot extract the zip file, I recommend you to download another file manager like [zarchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver) or [RAR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarlab.rar).
* If you have not set your minecraft in external mode, the previous step does'nt works.
* Start your minecraft and go to the skin pack manager
* select the skin you want and enjoy. ;p
